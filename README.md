# Sofia_The_Princess
 Well just a Birthday card for Birthday Princess

Just a Birthday card for you Sofia, and well if you noticed the background image... I actually made it, where I added a field of flowers because you like flowers and replaced the sky with space/galaxy as of your interest and added some stars representing how bright and beautiful you are, and about the girl, that girl kinda represents you, ik she isn't as cute and pretty as you but I certainly cannot draw you lol so that is the girl representing you with a flower crown as of a Princess on her head.
Now if we head over to the card, It is of green color or especifically "MINT" green hehe, your favorite color and balloons Blue and Red (Blaugrana) representing FC Barcelona and I wrote what I wrote inside the card. : )
