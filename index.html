            <p>Wishing you a very happy birthday Sofia, filled with love and laughter.
            You're not a year older but a year wiser as your name means and even more lovable.
            Idk how many times I have said about your smile, laugh, voice and cuteness but i won't get back on your special day. Your
            smile is precious idk and idc about others but i love it(and you too? eheheh), your silly and different types of laughter my mind can never
            forget, and you're already soo cute and your voice makes you cuter that i feel like biting lmao. Yeah, ab aur bada
            message aayega nahi iss card pe and certainly when I start talking about you I can't stop so yeah....
            Enjoy your day, Happy Birthday Sofia!
            Warmest wishes,
            Puru ð“ƒµ</p>
